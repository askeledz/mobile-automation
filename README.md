# cross-platform-mobile testing
An Appium (java) example project for cross platform testing of an Android and an iOS application

Instructions:

1. Download and setup Appium (see http://appium.io/getting-started.html)

2. Import this project as a maven project in e.g. IntelliJ or Eclipse.

3. Set the executionOS variable in the AppiumController class (src/test/java/AppiumSupport/AppiumController.java) to Android or iOS depending on what platform you want to execute the example test on. (For Android it should work to run on both emulator and device but for iOS it will only work on the simulator.)

4. Start the appium server and run the example test “searchContact” in src/test/java/Test/SmokeUITestsjava.
